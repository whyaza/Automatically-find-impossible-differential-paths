Automatically find impossible differential paths

Constructed by using the idea of meeting in the middle, a 4-round impossible difference divider is automatically searched.

The method of searching for impossible differences mainly relies on:
After the forward difference propagates to a certain place, the blocks of a cipher are equal; after the backward difference propagates to this place, the blocks of this cipher are not equal.
This leads to a contradiction, that is, an impossible differential path is obtained.
